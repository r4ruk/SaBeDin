client_service:
 - handle different params

request_handler:
 - develop a method, which handles errors and errorstatus codes and gives back
   a Result which can then be returned generally
 - currently statically implemented on line 35

  - DEBUG Handler if query params are extracted as expected:
  send curl:
  curl '127.0.0.1:7878/client?param1=1&param2=asdf'


General todo:
[] think about exception handling

next step:
[X] Introduce BL layer
[X] rename lookup_client to client_factory
[X] add Cors layer to accept requests from browser
[X] start with easy frontend work to see if the communication is working
[] Add persistence layer
[] Add seed data minimum for users. (for authentication)
[] Add authentication Middleware

further work
[] handle response serialization with status codes (for example: request handler health check returning OK)
[] add unittests for all implementations already done
[] think about general serialization/deserialization into classes in ts.
